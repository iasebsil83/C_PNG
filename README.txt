This program is a simple utility library that will allow you to manipulate
PNG files a little bit easier.
It uses the standard libpng.h library.

A demonstration program is made in src/prog.c.

More information about this library are available in lib/PNG.c.

DISCLAIMER : This program is not a substitute of the existing C libraries but a complement.
             libpng.h gives a lot of options on png files management, this library is a way much simpler.
